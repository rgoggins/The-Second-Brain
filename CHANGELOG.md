# Timeline for this Repository
## February 12
- Create this repository because the previous repository that I was working out of was having difficulty handling view controller adjustments and proper formatting for a single-view based application. Add all of the starting files + add code for handling user input. I replicate all of my previous work into the new, correctly attributed XCode project.

## February 13
- Accept pull request from Ahmet. The pull request will add a few necessary files and adjust the storyboard to include extra view controllers.

## February 15
- Accept another pull request from Ahmet. The pull request made some adjustments to the README.

## February 16
- Accept another pull request from Ahmet. The pull request includes an addition of another view controller and the 

## February 17
- I begin researching Google's Firebase, which is a webapp that allows xCode developers to establish databases for storing their client's data. I begin to use CocoaPods in conjunction with Firebase to facilitate writing by the user and reading by myself. Also, I merge another pull request from Ahmet that has changes to the storyboard.

## February 18
- I add the primary connection to Firebase and FirebaseDatabase that I researched in the past two days.

## February 19
- I configure the database so that I can write to it and read from it. I still am unable to pass in information in the proper format to the database so that it handles it correctly and so that it is stored in the proper location.

## February 22
- I continue working on the database, still encountering some difficulties handling the Any? type of objects, but I work through most of them.

## February 25
- I have updated much of the UI locally, but have yet to push the changes.

## February 27
- I push previous changes to the UI. I work alongside Rudd on changing my input handling slightly so that it is easier for other developers to follow my work. Rudd and I also work on passing messages between viewcontrollers. I implement the search viewcontroller and the ability to search tags and to query the database and return notes with associated tags. I also update the newer version of CocoaPods so that I can better utilize their functions to interact with the Firebase database.

# [TIMELINE PRIOR TO SCRAPPING PREVIOUS REPOSITORY]:
## January 28
- I create the repository, initialize a README. For this first week or so, I will likely be working on tutorials in Swift and Ruby because I have never used either of these languages and the entire XCode interface is new to me.

## January 29
- I have finished two tutorials in XCode. At this point, I am still figuring out how to properly navigate the storyboard and establish it's connection with the view controller files.

## February 2
- I create a license because I feel that I have a good understanding of the XCode interface and a good grasp of how Swift works in correlation with it. 

## February 5
- I receive my first pull request! This one comes from Jungwoo who so kindly creates a Code of Conduct for me! I gladly accept the pull request. Also, I update the first view controller that I will be working with that day so that it can handle user input. I encounter a big difficulty with syntax of handling swipes, but Dr. Z helps me a lot in class. 

## February 9
- I work more on the view controllers that I have created, but I think that I started out the XCode project with the wrong preset classes and it would be extremely beneficial for me to transfer to the "Single-View-Application".
